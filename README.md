## 📁 Project Structure

### `src/labs/`

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cp/` | **Cartpole Regression Learning** – Implements regression-based approaches to learn and balance the classic Cartpole problem. |
| `infexf/agents/` | **A\* Agent** – A pathfinding agent that uses the A* algorithm to navigate environments efficiently. |
| `stealth/` | **BFS Agent** – A stealth agent using Breadth-First Search (BFS) for grid-based navigation. |
| `zomtree/agents/` | **Decision Tree Agent** – Agent using decision trees for making strategic moves to avoid zombies. |

### `src/pas/`

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `chess/` | **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** – A chess-playing agent that uses Minimax search optimized with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine optimal moves. |
| `tetris/` | **Reinforcement Learning with Custom Heuristic** – A Tetris agent trained via reinforcement learning, enhanced with custom heuristics for better state evaluation. |
